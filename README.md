# DecroWM
## Overview
DecroWM is a minimal window manager written in C++,
which aims to add some functionality and fixes on top of TinyWM,
making it slightly more practical for everyday usage.

## TinyWM
TinyWM was written by Nick Welch `nick@incise.org` in 2005 & 2011,
and is under the public domain.

## Changes over TinyWM
* Better Makefile, allowing for
**installation** and **uninstallation** of the program;
* **Removal** of the **Python** and **annotated** versions;
* **Modern README** file using **Markdown**;
* **Improved keybindings**;
* **Window closing** and **window manager termination** functionality;
* **Fixed** window **focusing** issue;
* **Modern C++** codebase.

## Usage
The keybindings below are the default in DecroWM.
* `Mod` + `Button1` & drag: move window;
* `Mod` + `Button3` & drag: resize window;
* `Mod` + (`Button1` | `Button3`) (click): raise window and focus on it.
