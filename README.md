# DecroWM
DecroWM is a fork of TinyWM, written by Nick Welch `nick@incise.org` in 2005 & 2011, and licensed under the public domain.

## Overview
DecroWM is a minimal window manager written in C,
which aims to add some functionality and fixes on top of TinyWM,
making it slightly more practical for everyday usage.

## Changes over TinyWM
* Better Makefile, allowing for
**installation** and **uninstallation** of the program;
* **Removal** of the **Python** and **annotated** versions;
* **Modern README** file using **Markdown**.

## Usage
* `Alt` + `Button1` & drag: move window;
* `Alt` + `Button3` & drag: resize window;
* `Alt` + `F1`: raise window and focus on it.
